# astroproject
This is a repo for my hobby project.

This is my week one project assignment for the Nov '23 Software Development Bootcamp at The Developer Academy. 

The aim of this project is to create a personal website on a topic of our choosing, which can be on any topic of your choosing (hobby, family, interest), using the technologies learnt in week 1 - HTML and Tailwind CSS.

The site is built with basic HTML and Tailwind CSS. It consists of 5 pages: 1. Home Page 2. About 3. Form 4. Contact, and 5. Post form submission page.

The site can be viewed here: https://tapetone.github.io/astroproject/
